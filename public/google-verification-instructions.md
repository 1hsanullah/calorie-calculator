# Next Steps for Your Google Search Logo

Your site is already verified in Google Search Console, which is great! Now let's focus on getting your custom logo to appear in search results.

## 1. Request Indexing for Your Logo

1. In Google Search Console, use the "URL Inspection" tool at the top search bar
2. Enter your logo URL: `https://www.calorietest.com/google-logo.svg`
3. Click "Request Indexing"
4. Repeat this process for your structured data page (your homepage): `https://www.calorietest.com/`

## 2. Check for Schema Validation

1. Visit [Google's Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results)
2. Enter your site URL: `https://www.calorietest.com/`
3. Check if your Logo and Organization schema are detected without errors
4. Fix any errors that might prevent Google from recognizing your logo

## 3. Increase Site Authority

Google prioritizes displaying custom logos for sites with higher authority. Some ways to improve this:

1. Ensure your site has high-quality content
2. Build natural backlinks from reputable sites
3. Share your site on social media to increase traffic and engagement
4. Make sure your site loads fast and has good Core Web Vitals scores

## 4. Be Patient

- It typically takes 1-4 weeks for Google to recrawl and update your site in search results
- Logo displays are not guaranteed - Google has its own criteria for when they show custom logos
- Sites with higher traffic and authority are more likely to have their logos displayed
- Continue to check your site in incognito search results periodically

## 5. Additional Logo Specifications

For best results, ensure your logo:
- Has a transparent background if appropriate
- Is square or has a 1:1 aspect ratio
- Is at least 112Ã—112 pixels
- Is in SVG format (which you already have)
