# Immediate Actions in Google Search Console

Now that you've seen your sitemap is indexing successfully, follow these quick steps to get your logo discovered by Google:

## Step 1: Resubmit your updated sitemap

1. Go to the Sitemaps section in Google Search Console (where you are now)
2. Click on your existing sitemap to remove it
3. Add your sitemap again by entering `sitemap.xml` in the field and clicking "Submit"
4. This will tell Google to check your new sitemap that includes the logo URL

## Step 2: Request indexing for your logo

1. Use the search bar at the top of Google Search Console
2. Enter the full URL: `https://www.calorietest.com/google-logo.svg`
3. Click "URL Inspection"
4. Click "Request Indexing"
5. Repeat this process for your homepage: `https://www.calorietest.com/`

## Step 3: Check your structured data

1. Visit [Google's Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results)
2. Paste in your website URL
3. Check if your logo is being detected through the Organization or WebSite schema
4. If there are any errors, fix them in your site's code

## Step 4: Monitor performance

1. Check the "Coverage" section in Google Search Console in the next few days
2. Look for your logo URL to ensure it's being indexed without errors
3. Be patient - it will take time for Google to update their search results

Remember, even after doing everything correctly, it may take several weeks for Google to update how your site appears in search results, and there's no guarantee they'll use your custom logo.
